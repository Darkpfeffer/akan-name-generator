            <p>
                The Akan people are living in Ghana and in parts of Ivery Coast and
                 Togo in West Africa. So to say, they are the ancient Ghanians.

            <p>
                In the 12th century's gold boom brought wealth to numerous Akans.
                 Because of this they could rose to the well known Akan empire. Their
                 wealth did two major things: attracted European traders
                 and waged war with the neighboring states. The Akans captured their 
                 enemys and sold them to the traders. In exchange of Akan gold and slaves
                 they got guns and slaves from the traders. The Akans needed the brought
                 slaves to clear out the dense forests within Ashanti.
                 Their cultural attributes are:<br>
                 - tracing of matrilineal descent<br>
                 - inheritance of property<br>
                 - succession to high political office<br>
