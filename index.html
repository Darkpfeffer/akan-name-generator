        <h4>A bit of History</h4>
        <p>
            In the 12th century's gold boom brought wealth to numerous Akans.
             Because of this they could rose to the well known Akan empire. Their
             wealth did two major things: attracted European traders
             and waged war with the neighboring states. The Akans captured their 
             enemys and sold them to the traders. In exchange of Akan gold and slaves
             they got guns and slaves from the traders. The Akans needed the brought
             slaves to clear out the dense forests within Ashanti.
